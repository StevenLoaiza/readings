Michael Lewis writes mundane topics in an interesting light. I have read The Premonition, The Undoing Project, Flash Boys, Liar’s Poker and saw films based on his writing, namely The Blind Side and The Big Short. Each of these is about economics or finance (not the most exciting topics). But somehow Michael Lewis adds a spark to the topic and brings it to life. I am now working my way back to some of his earlier work, starting with Boomerang.

*Like anything in life, moderation is key.*

Cheap credit is a wonderful thing. We would all love to borrow from the bank for our student loans, personal renovation, and housing at the lowest interest rate possible. But just because the credit is “cheap” does not equate to a heightened ability to repay the loan. Fiscal responsibility is knowing how much to borrow such that you do not become insolvent. But as we all know, credit sometimes gets the better of us and we begin to rack up debt. We saw this happen in the United States with the housing bubble.

Lewis describes an era of indulgent activities and instant gratification that was otherwise unattainable. But it was not isolated to the United States, bubbles were forming well beyond our shores. Michael Lewis set out to investigate bubbles and his journey led him to Iceland. Lewis states that “[i]n 2006 the average Icelandic family was three times as wealthy… [compared to] 2003” (pg. 2), this was tied to investment banking in the country. Accumulation of wealth is great, but not at the expense of your future self. Icelanders would go on to amass debt around 850 percent of their Gross Domestic Product and the economy would go boom by 2008.

To gain access to cheap credit, people all-out lied. The Greek government in particular would omit high-priced items from their measurement of the consumer price index (CPI). They also “lower[ed] the budget deficit … [by moving] expenses off the books” (pg. 61). This allowed them to enter the European Monetary Union and borrow at lower interest rates. What did the countries, and consumers, in particular, do with this influx of capital? Icelanders took advantage of the interest rate arbitrage, between their currency and foreign monies. In Ireland new housing development boomed, but “there were never enough people in Ireland to fill the new houses” (pg. 121). This last point highlights the main problem with debt, that if it does not have returns then how will the creditors be paid?

Apart from the dense metrics above, we also get some funny stories in the reading. Lewis highlights Germany’s positive disposition towards feces. He goes on to explain that Hitler’s doctors spent time examining his feces and that there is evidence in favor of his sexual preference toward feces. As a literary, this all ties back to the main story of the debt crisis. It leads to his point that “Germany longed to be near the shit, but not in it” a visual representation of their role in the European financial crisis.

Everyone kept partying even though the music stopped, the lights went out, and the building was on fire. Consumers had a delusional optimism that the “good times” were perpetual and that there was no limit. After the money is spent, the creditor comes knocking for their repayment. The governments are unable to pay their debts because the public is evading taxes by misrepresenting their income (pg. 51) and why bother realizing the losses when the government will rescue you (pg 105, 113). The problem runs deeper than this, and the chapters have a way of telling a story that is both informative and interesting.
